# Firebase-Wallpaper-App

I built this usnig Java, Firebase Storage, Firebase Autication with google and Firebase Database.
This will run with Internet Connection.

1. Linking of firebase with Android Studio.

2. Dealing with Gallery Intent to fetch and Image to upload.

3. Uploading Image to the Firebase Storage and getting the downloadable link of it.

4. Pushing the URL into the Firebase Real-Time Database.

5. Retreiving the pushed data from the database.

6. Using Firebase-UI to populate the RecyclerView with the retreived data.
